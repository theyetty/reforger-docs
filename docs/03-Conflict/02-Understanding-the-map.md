# Understanding the map

## Symbology
On the map there is multiple objectives, you will see some symbols, here is what they mean.


### Bases

Bases have three distinct symbols depending on the faction. The larger the symbol on the map the bigger the base is. 

The symbol below in any base means that its your base and you can spawn there.

#### US Base

The US bases are marked with a blue rectangle.

This specific symbol means this is a tower. Towers are not bases but they increase the teams radio range by a lot. They are very strategic to capture.

#### Soviet Base

FIA bases are controlled by AI, by default at the start of the round they control all bases. These basses are marked by a green square.

#### Supply Base

These are bases controlled by FIA which will allow you to grab supplies from them, they have a lot of supplies which respawn, the defenders of these bases are FIA and you will need to kill them, they respawn after a certain amount of time.

#### *Unknown Base

These are bases which are outside of your current radio range. You can extend the radio range and see who controls them currently.

#### Base Information

If you hover over any base it will give you information about the base.

The top line **Main Operating Base** indicates the name. There is then symbols below this which indicate what has been built at the base, from left to right they are.

2. Light Vehicle Base (Allows you to spawn light vehicles and repair them)
3. Heavy Vehicle Base (Allows you to spawn heavy vehicles and repair them)
4. Field Hospital (Allows you to heal and spawn AI units)
5. Field Barracks (Allows you to spawn AI)
6. Tower Relay (Increases the radio range of the base, allowing you to capture more)
7. Helicopter Pad (Allows spawning of helicopters)

### Objectives

#### Current Objective

Your current objective is marked by a blue triange. You can select inactive objectives and assign them as your primary objective, this will allow others to see you are going to capture it and gives you bonus XP.

#### In-active Objective
![alt text](inactive-obj.png)

This is a base which you can capture but is not your current objective. You can select it to make it your active objective.
