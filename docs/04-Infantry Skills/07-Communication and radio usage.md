# Voice Communications

Most Conflict servers rely on some form of voice comms. Clear, concise messages are critical. Follow these guidelines:

- Brevity: “Contact front! Two enemy riflemen near the blue lorry!” – short and direct.
- Proper Channels: Use local/positional voice chat for immediate squad talk. Use long-range or group radio only when necessary, so as not to clutter vital communication.

## Reporting Contacts
When you spot an enemy or come under fire, use a quick, standard format:
1. Direction: Cardinal (North, East) or clock face relative to your facing.
2. Distance: A rough estimate in metres.
3. Description: “Two riflemen behind a stone wall.”
