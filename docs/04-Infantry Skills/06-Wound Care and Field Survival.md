# Wound Care and Field Survival

Although more simplified than in advanced mods, Arma Reforger still demands attention to injuries:
- Immediate Action: If injured, get to cover, then treat wounds if you have bandages or a field dressing.
- Medics: In a well-organised team, at least one player often carries additional medical supplies and can revive teammates faster.
