## Team and Squad Organisation
A typical Arma Reforger infantry squad often consists of 6–12 players, split into two or more fireteams plus a squad leader. In some server configurations, squads might be smaller. Regardless, the guiding principle remains: each group must have a designated leader and a clear chain of command.

### Squad Leader (SL)
The central coordinator. Responsible for communicating with higher command, marking objectives, and directing squad movements.

### Fireteam Leaders (FTLs)
Each leads a small group of riflemen, often including a mix of special roles: automatic rifleman, anti-tank soldier, medic, etc.

### Riflemen
Form the bulk of the unit, providing flexible combat power. They deal with anything from scouting and frontal attacks to defensive perimeter setups

## Buddy Teams
The smallest practical fighting element in Arma Reforger is the buddy team, consisting of two players who watch one another’s backs. This arrangement ensures that:
1. No One Operates Alone - If one is taken out, the other can respond.
2. Immediate Support - Buddies can provide security while the other reloads, or flank an enemy from two angles without losing cohesion

Your responsibilities to your buddy:
1. Stay Nearby: Never stray too far, else you lose mutual support.
2. Coordinate Movement: If your buddy moves to cover, remain in position to suppress threats. Then move yourself when they are ready to cover you in turn.
3. Share Intel: If you see movement, confirm whether your buddy also sees it. Two sets of eyes are better than one.

## Fireteam Coordination
Within the broader fireteam, buddy teams merge into a single coherent unit. Coordination points include:
1. Sector Coverage: Each pair covers a specific arc, preventing gaps in observation.
2. Bounding Overwatch: One buddy team moves forward whilst the other covers, then they switch. This technique significantly reduces the chance of being surprised.
3. Rapid Reaction: If one buddy team comes under fire, the other immediately applies flanking or suppressive fire to relieve pressure.
