## Cover, Concealment & Situational Awareness

### Cover
Solid objects like stone walls, thick trees, or the engine block of a lorry that can stop or deflect bullets

### Concealment
Objects that hide you from view but do not necessarily stop bullets—tall grass, fences, bushes, smoke.

Always try to combine both: remain out of direct sight behind concealment, yet close to robust cover if you’re fired upon.

## The Value of Spacing
Maintain intervals of several metres between teammates. Grenades, artillery or a single machine gun burst can otherwise inflict multiple casualties. Sticking too close together invites disaster.

## Situational Awareness
You must constantly gather information from sight and sound:
1. Look for Movement: Even a pixel shift in the distance could signal an enemy creeping through the undergrowth.
2. Listen for Gunfire Echoes: Shots in a forest environment may sound different from those near concrete walls. Directional audio is your friend.
3. Map Updates: Frequently check your map for updated objective statuses, possible friendly positions, or any Intel placed by your squad leader.

Tunnel vision is your worst enemy. Engaging one target exclusively can blind you to flanking manoeuvres.
