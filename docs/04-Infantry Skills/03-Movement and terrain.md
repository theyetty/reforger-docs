## Movement and Terrain Exploitation
In Reforger’s Conflict environment, the terrain varies from forests and hills to farmland and villages. Movement techniques must be adapted accordingly.

1. Use Covered Routes: Avoid marching straight down a road or across open ground. Utilize ditches, walls, hedgerows and buildings.
2. Micro-Terrain: Even small undulations in the land can shield you from view. Learn to “hug” the terrain whenever possible.
3. Slow is Smooth; Smooth is Fast: Rushing blindly often leads to exhaustion and poor reaction times. Move steadily, keep stamina in check.

## Bounding Overwatch
A cornerstone of infantry movement is bounding overwatch, wherein you alternate between advancing and covering. This drastically reduces your vulnerability by ensuring at least half your team is scanning for threats at all times.

1. Team A covers while Team B moves.
2. Team B finds cover, calls “Set!”
3. Team A moves while Team B covers.

Bounding overwatch excels in moderate to high-threat environments, especially near objectives or if you suspect an ambush.

## Urban Movement
1. Villages and towns in Arma Reforger can be lethal if approached carelessly:
Avoid Skylining on Rooftops: Only expose yourself on a building’s roof if you have a clear plan to exit rapidly.
2. Check Windows & Corners: Ensure you “slice the pie” when entering a building—angle yourself so you see inside before an occupant sees you.
3. Move Inside in Pairs: Never clear large buildings solo. Have a buddy to watch your flank.
